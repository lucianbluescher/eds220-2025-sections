    "The data was collected from nine public, recorded meetings of water control boards and official organizations in the Colorado River Basin as well as articles from newspapers describing water-related events in geographic areas in the Basin based on methods established by Dr. Nathan Eidem. The observations collected are from the 2005 - 2021 time frame. The value of this data is in understanding social vulnerability to water insecurity, resiliency demonstrated by institutions, and conflict or crisis around water resource management.\n",
